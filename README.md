# Software Discovery Dashboard

## Synopsis

>This projectâ€™s objective is to create an open source web dashboard capable of searching multiple code hosting services, such as Zenodo, Figshare, and GitHub, for the benefit of the research community. The goal of this dashboard is to demonstrate the usefulness of a [new metadata standard](https://github.com/mbjones/codemeta) by utilizing it for easy and effective software discovery and analysis.
